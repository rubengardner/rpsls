Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (RPSLS) is an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla. This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article in *The Times* of London and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom *The Big Bang Theory* in 2008.

This website is created to have fun playing this game against the computer. The game is entirely based on chance and the website is easy to navigate in order to easily find the rules, the game area and the feedback form in case the user wants to leave any comments.
